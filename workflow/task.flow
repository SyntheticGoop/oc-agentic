: Do immediately
* to initial_loaded:
  Call `get_project` to load current task list.
  List summary of files changed with `jj diff --summary -r @`.
  Display detailed list of current task status to the user.
  Ask what the user wants to do and only proceed on explicit confirmation.

  Use `oc-agentic-investigator` to extract task details from actual file changes and commit context. 
  You must pass all the information you have gathered, as well as 
  You must explictly instruct for the following: Changes must be based off why a file was changed from its previous code to its current code. That change can be extracted using `jj diff --context 0 --git -r @ FILENAME` for the current changes. Ground your full understading of final outcomes with `jj file show -r @ FILENAME` for the file without diffs. YOU MUST NOT BASE IT OFF THE ENTIRE FILE'S CONTENT BLINDLY.
  Announce the investigator conclusions out loud.
  Use `oc-agentic-inquisitor` for iterative plan refinement until task specification accurately reflects completed work.
  Announce the inquisitor conclusions out loud.
